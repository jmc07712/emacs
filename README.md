# Emacs Configuration

## Installation

### Windows
On Windows, simply put this `.emacs` file in your HOME directory specified by emacs. This is usually 
```sh
C:\Users\<username>\AppData
```

### Linux
Place the `.emacs` file in your HOME (`~/`) directory. That's it!

### Installing Dependencies
There will also be somethings that you need to do. They are:
```sh
<M+x> package-refresh-contents>
<M+x> package-install RET
gruvbox-theme
<M+x> package-install RET
auto-complete
<M+x> package-install RET
airline-themes
<M+x> package-install RET
powerline
```

This completes it! Enjoy!
